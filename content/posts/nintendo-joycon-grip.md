Alex lost our second official Nintendo Joy-Con grip and was stealing mine so I thought I would try
printing one of the prints on Thingiverse as a replacement. The first one we tried was [Nintendo Switch Joy-con Grip (store the strap)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2523187).

I printed it with a raft due to its small surface area on the build plate and with .2 layer height. Due to its steep overhangs I also 45deg zig zag supports on build plate only. The print took about 5 hours. I also opted to goto 101% scale as I saw in the comments some people having issues with the tolerances.

Both Alex and I were instantly impressed! Its both simple and comfortable and the joy-cons fit perfectly and even click in and release using the button just like the official grip.

The original STL can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2523187)
