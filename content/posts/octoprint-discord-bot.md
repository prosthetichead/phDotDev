One of the most useful plugins I have found for Octoprint is a Discord remote control bot.
I tried a few ways of keeping tabs of where my prints were up to including even streaming to Twitch, 
but none of them were ever quite right for me until I found [OctoPrint-DiscordRemote](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/discordremote/).

If you use discord I highly recomend looking at this plugin as a way to check on prints and remote control if needed.
